##General app overview
The whole idea was to create an app that contents of basic user interactions, authorization method and multiple environments usage. App is continously under construction, as I am constantly learn new things as a developer.

###InvoiceR functionalities
Whole app is made for users to create their own companies and invoices with specified costs. The app is not strictly intranet-like because I wanted to implement payments and OAuth with some providers. Also, basic messaging system will be implemented for users with premium accounts.

###TODO list
